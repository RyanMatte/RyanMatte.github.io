        "Shirt Size": "L",
        "What is your shoe size?": "11.5",
        "List off some of your hobbies or some interests you have": "I am into collecting Vinyl Records, I like 3d printing, Dungeons and Dragons, Coding/Computers, Rubik's Cubes, playing Guitar, fancy coffee (both brewing and buying the beans)",
        "What are some of your favourite anime": "Neon Genesis Evangelion, Attack on Titan, Komi Can't Communicate",
        "What is your favourite TV shows": "Paul is my favorite movie, Strangers things is my favourite show",
        "Who are your favourite musical artists": "Tiny Moving Parts, American Football, TTNG, Protest the Hero, CHON, Polyphia, Lorna Shore, Between the Buried and Me, Opeth, The Contortionist, Plini, Covet",
        "What is something you really want to get into (hobby, music, etc.) but you've never had the chance?": "I really like rock climbing but I have trouble getting into it, I want to try more styles of guitar besides metal, I love cooking but never have the time and I want to get into making espresso but I just have a v60 for making filter coffee",
        "What is one of the best Christmas gifts you've received?": "My favourite gift was when Abbey got me tickets to see the Contortionist V.I.P. <3",
        "What are some things that you have enough of or don't want anymore of": "I am very much good on band shirts and posters. I don't really see myself wearing something with an anime character on it, or having something like that on a shelf tbh. I have a lot of between the buried and me and chon stuff, so maybe try to avoid that. I am a bit of a snob when it comes to coffee shit, so I would say avoid buying beans far in advance as they don't hold for long at all, as well Starbucks and Grocery store ones are usually dark roast coffee and a bit hard to drink. I would 100% say go online for that kind of stuff! I am done with the rubik's cube hobby so avoid that as well. ",
        "Is there anything you collect or would want to add to a collection?": "I like fun clothes/sweaters, I like collecting Vinyl, Guitar Pedals and DND stuff like dice or merch. If you need something to fill in the rest of the value, I always like cool socks or candles, even something small like guitar picks. Oh and some tab books from artists I like would be sweet, go on sheet happens publishing or something similar. ",
        "Optionally Add images of your collection to avoid buying duplicates": "",
        "Would you rather get 1 large gift or a bunch of smaller gifts?": "1 large gift",
        "What are some of your favourite snacks": "I love coffee my favourite roasters are Onyx, Ethica, Rogue Wave and Hatch, but I would love to try some new varieties. I have tried some nicer coffees but never Geisha varietals and usually only drink lighter roasted coffee and single origin coffee. Usually Ethiopian and Rwandan coffees are my go to, but I also enjoy Columbian and Honduran coffee a lot. I have drank a lot of Natural/Washed process coffee and have experimented a bit with anaerobic and honey based fermentation coffees. I am big into beer, but I have no clue if you can ship that to Canada.\n\nFor food, I like skittles, but I am also a sucker for Italian stuff like Biscotti, Ameretti and Torrone",
        "Is there anything else you want to indicate to your Secret Santa (please do not include any specific gift ideas, just any general interests that could have been missed by the questionnaire)": "I did indicate that one big gift would be cool, but if that isn't possible I like small things as well on the side. For Vinyls be wary that my record player does not support 45 rpm or 75 rpm records. I am going to anime NYC so that might be a good place to gauge some ideas? Anyhow good luck!",
