This project is a web app called "Werth It", where users can post deals or potential purchases they are considering, and have their peers decide whether or not these are good deals, or a high price.

The website allows users to post their own deals, or comment on others with feedback, as well as link to other deals on the website. Each user profile will have a level of reliability, which increases whenever another user finds a comment they have helpful to them. Users can browse deals by location, by type of good, and by how good of a deal they are. Additionally, users can search by keywords.

This is being made for CSI3140 - WWW Structures and Techniques, as taught by Dr. Andrew Forward.
